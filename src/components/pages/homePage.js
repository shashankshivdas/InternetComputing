           Virat Kohli has always considered Sachin Tendulkar his inspiration.

           "He's (Tendulkar) been my inspiration. After seeing his knocks in Sharjah, I really got inspired to do something like that for India, win games single-handedly. I used to dream of doing something like that for the country, the way he used to win us games," he said. "I wouldn't sit and think that I've done something similar because at that time I don't think anyone else in the team scored apart from him in those two games. Now, there are others like Shikhar (Dhawan) and Rohit (Sharma)."
